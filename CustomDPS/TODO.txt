1. I should switch the displayDPS to using a more smooth and accurate method of keeping X amount of
   events in a queue and, once the queue reaches some size (like 60 at 60fps), push/pop one event so it stays at that size.
   Update DPS by averaging damage from all of the events in the queue against its size. Remember that an event in the queue
   can be `nil` if there was no damage event from that tick. This is semi-similar to the way I use now, except every update the damage buffer
   will be emptied into a queue event
2. I need to track party member DPS. Maybe keep a running tally of people who join a party or who are in a party I join, remove them when I leave
   a party or they leave the party I am in

2.a. Building on this, maybe have a boss DPS. I can also have a boss DPS and party healing per second to see what our shortfall is on heals
2.a.b. Can also make some sort of "estimate until target is dead" if we have the boss health and party dps

3. Do something more interesting when exiting combat. Ex, display "Average DPS in your last combat encounter: x"
4. Numerical formatting - seeing 473829 dps is not helpful. I should either add comma formatting or display the dps in thousands (473k)
