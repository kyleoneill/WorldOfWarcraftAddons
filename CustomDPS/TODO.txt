1. Need to improve group functionality, specifically better capture group events. Should be using more accurate events, like
   "group joined", "member_left", "member_joined", etc. The current event fires every time somebody phases.

2. Make the UI actually good.
2.a. This [HOWTO](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/HOWTOs) has pages on UI stuff
   - Draggable frames - https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Making_draggable_frames
   - Resizable frames - https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Making_resizable_frames

3. Ordering party members based on their DPS
   - Would be helpful to separate the logged in player so the "most relevant" dps can be seen easily
4. I don't think I'm counting damage done by pets/familiars when they should be
   - Ex, hunter pet, warlock demon, etc
5. Have the addon remember where the user moved it to when initilizing so they don't need to move it every time

Button toggle, only display my dps or display the entire groups

Maybe another button toggle to reset the DPS and then change when DPS is reset?
- Maybe just pause the tallying of DPS when out of combat rather than entirely clearing it out, this seems much more reasonable

fix display or max out how much is displayed when in large groups

   - event trace, extremely useful tool for seeing the event stream in wow
