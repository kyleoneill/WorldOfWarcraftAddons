1. Need to improve group functionality, specifically better capture group events. Should be using more accurate events, like
   "group joined", "member_left", "member_joined", etc. The current event fires every time somebody phases.

2. Make the UI actually good.
2.a. This [HOWTO](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/HOWTOs) has pages on UI stuff
   - Draggable frames - https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Making_draggable_frames
   - Resizable frames - https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Making_resizable_frames

3. Ordering party members based on their DPS
   - Would be helpful to separate the logged in player so the "most relevant" dps can be seen easily
4. Clearing a member out of the group table when they leave the party
   - A table is entirely emptied when the group is left, but I should be clearing out a players entry when they leave the party
