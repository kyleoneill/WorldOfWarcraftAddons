1. I need to track party member DPS. Maybe keep a running tally of people who join a party or who are in a party I join, remove them when I leave
   a party or they leave the party I am in
1.a. Building on this, maybe have a boss DPS. I can also have a boss DPS and party healing per second to see what our shortfall is on heals
1.a.b. Can also make some sort of "estimate until target is dead" if we have the boss health and party dps

2. Make the UI actually good.
2.a. This [HOWTO](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/HOWTOs) has pages on UI stuff
   - Draggable frames - https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Making_draggable_frames
   - Resizable frames - https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Making_resizable_frames

3. After there is group functionality, ordering party members based on their DPS
   - Would be helpful to separate the logged in player so the "most relevant" dps can be seen easily
4. After there is group functionality, clearing a member out of the group table when they leave the party
   - A table is entirely emptied when the group is left, but I should be clearing out a players entry when they leave the party
